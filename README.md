# Digimon-Generator-GAN
This repo contains the code that generates Digimon images using the concept of Generative Adversarial Networks

GANs are very hard to train. So, just clone or download the notebook `Generate_new_digimons.ipynb` and run all the cells on an external local GPU or on Cloud to see the better results.

This code also adds scalars and test images to the tensorboard for better visualization. 

### Tensorboard graph for training a small dataset(195 images) of digimons:

### Tensorboard graph for training a large dataset(1061 images) of digimons:
This graph is quite big, so I can't cover it in a single screenshot
